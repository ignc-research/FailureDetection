# How to train an object detection model with MMDetection on own dataset

Here should be the installation folder of MMDetection.

- A good demo for training own data with [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tony607/mmdetection_object_detection_demo/blob/master/mmdetection_train_custom_data.ipynb).
- [Official tutorial](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb).
- Paper: [MMDetection: Open MMLab Detection Toolbox and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07155)



## How to use

1. step by step to adapt own dataset.
2. ...

### TODO

```
- [x] adapt to own dataset: class && config
- [ ] config: config.py
- [ ] Monitor training
- [ ] Reference
- [ ] Evaluation
```
