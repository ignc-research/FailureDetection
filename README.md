# Industrial Failure Detection with Neural Networks



## Overview

Train Faster R-CNN, Cascase R-CNN, and RetinaNet models on Tensorpack and MMDetection with thermal images for failure detection.

1. Prepare dataset

   1. Extract thermal(Thereâ€™re 115 films in total, 250 images contained in each of them.)
   2. Data filtering: bluring, and adjacent similiar images.
   3. Labeling: **[LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)**, save annotaions with **Pascal VOC** data format. Used labels refer to 'data_engineering'.
   4. Test set: pick out 10(including all labels) films for final test.
   5. Augmentation: find the needed scripts in the folder 'augmentation'.

2. Setup training frameworks

   1. Install [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)

      Relatted Adaptation: data foler; class names; used detectior; pre-trained model; results folder.

   2. Install [Tensorpack](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack)

      Relatted Adaptation: data foler; class names; used detectior; pre-trained model; results folder.

3. Start training

   1. Scripts provided. For ease of changing detectors, use some shell scripts.
   2. Monitoring the process with tensorboard(Tensorpack) and built-in tools(MMDetection).

4. Evaluation/Test (scripts provided).

5. Deployment:

   On platform Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier(Nvidia Xavier).
